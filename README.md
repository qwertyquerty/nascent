> A vertical scrolling rhythm game passion project

### Project Goals

The goal is to write a fast, lightweight, hit accurate, and clean implementation of an N-lane VSRG with a play performance calculator, custom chart file format, an in-game chart editor, support for importing many filetypes from other VSRGs, online play submissions, global ranking system, cheat detection, and more.

This project is meant to fix a lot of the problems I have with osu!mania and Etterna, taking the best of both worlds and adding some of my own. However, it is just a passion project and is not likely to be a drop-in replacement for either one at any point in its development.

The project will mostly serve as a learning experience and a good waste of time for me and any others who choose to collaborate on it.

### Collaboration

In reality I don't really know what I'm doing with C++ projects of this scale as I have few that span the goals of this game. I would love any help from people who know more than me about proper C++ project structure, software architecture, and optimizations.

Currently you can message me @qwertyquerty on Discord if you're interested in helping out, and I'll eventually make a community Discord server if the project takes off.

### Build instructions

I'll write up a more detailed build tutorial later on but I'm compiling everything just with msys2 mingw stuff right now.
